# Linux OS 
-Linux is an open sourse operating system model on UNIX. At its core is the Linux Kernel, 
Which makes the harwware resources and is the heart of the OS.
*stability *flexibility *popular for servers, *desktops, and *embeded systems.
Linux is used by individuals, companies, government worldwide cox it is cost effective and customizable.

## Desktop Env for Linux
GNOME: GNU Network Object Model is a user friendly and visually appealing desktop env.
KDE: K Desctop Env, it is highly confugurable and customizable.

## Linux Distributions (Distros)
Linux distro are versions of linux packaged by diff organization , 
each offfering comination of Linux Kernel GNU unitllities desctop env. 
and other software to meet specific needs

Ubuntu:  Is a  popular Linux dispto developed by Cononical LTD.widely used, has great documentations.
RedHat: Redhat enterprise Linux(RHEL) is a commertial distro of linux know for stability and support. 
  it is wideluy used in corp nad hat offers extensive support and services, 
  making it prefered choice for critical apps.

## GNU Projects
This project was lounched by Richard Stallman in 1983 to create a complex,
unix compatable software systems that consists of entirely free software.

Linux Operating System Component

Hardware Layer :
  This is the base physical components of your computer like CPU,RAM (random acces memmory),
hard drive (permanent storage),graphics card etc.

Linux Kernel :
  This is the core part of the operating syste, 
  It directly interaccts with hardware and provides services to upper leyer of the OS.
      Functions: It handles memeory management, task scheduling, input output requests from software, etc

Shell:
  It is a user interface for accesing the Kernal services,
  The shell listens command from user and translates them into actions Kernel can understand.
  There are text based shells like terminal or command line and (this is what is mostly refered as Shesll)
  But also the desctop interface could also be called as shell(rerealy).

Operating System Tool :
 These are basic utilities taht come with most Linux distributors,
  like file managment, system monitors, and network tools,

Windowing System:
  It provides foundation for displaying graphics and handling input devices like mouce or keyboard.

Desctop Environments :
  These are graphical interfaces we see like Ghenom , KDE or XCFE.
  They provide cohesive visual experiece with icons, wallpapers etc.

Applications :
  These are software programs that we run on our computer,like browser app, discord, etc.

Package Managers Is a software tool to automate the process of installing,updating,removing,configuring: 
  These handles software installation,upgrades and removals.
  They ,ake sure that all required libraries and components (dependancies)
  are present for installed software to work corectly.
  There are different package managers for different distro like apt, apt-get,yum,pacman,Dpkg etc.
  **Ubuntu** :apt-get
  **Amazon Linux** : yum
  
NOTES : CPU->Central Processing Unit
           It is the brain of computer, every process will be processed from here.
